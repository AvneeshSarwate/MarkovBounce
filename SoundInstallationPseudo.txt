class Listener
	
	voices - list of list of progressions
		voices[i] is a list of progressions of voice i
		voices[i][j] is nth progression of voice i
	progInd - what step in the progression it is
	voiceInd - which voice to play
	stateInd - which state/prog to play
	playing - whether the loop is playing

	realPlay()
		if playing
			phrase.play(voices[voiceInd][stateInd][progInd], voiceInd) //voiceInd specifies midi channel
			progInd += 1
			progInd %= 16
			if progInd == 0
				playing = false

	changeState() - in response to state button push
		state = stuff[0]

	startVoice() - in response to automatic state change form Markov Chain
		voiceInd = stuff[0]
		stateInd = stuff[1]
		playing = true
	//watch out for state of “playing" variable. make sure this and realPLay() don’t block each other

	pianoKey() - in response to a piano key down/up.  stuff = [note, on/off, channel]
		phrase.play(stuff[0], stuff[1], stuff[2])
	//“note" here is a chord object with 1 note in it
	//will receive a single midi note value, must put it into a chord before playing

class Sender

	MarkovChain - a stochastic matrix
	addresses - a list of addresses of computers in the network
	MarkovAddress - address of the computer currently playing the meldoy
	pianoAddresses - pianoKey to address mapping
		when a key goes down, that key is mapped to an address. when it comes up, the address is cleared
	keyToNote - the “key to note" mapping 
	stateInd, voiceInd, progInd - as above
	
	stepper() - in response to the metronome
		if progInd == 0 //ideally all files start on same index and metronome beat
			markovAddress = adresses[random(0-9)]
			stateInd = randomMarkovStep(markovChain, stateInd)
			send(markovAddress+"startVoice", voiceInd, state)

	markovButton() - in response to a top row button being pressed
		stateInd = addrToInd(addr)
		sebd(markovAddress+"changeState", stateInd)

	pianoButton()
		keyInd = addrToInd(addr)
		if stuff[0] == 1
			pianoAddresses[keyInd] = addresses[randpm(0-9)]
			send(pianoAdress[keyInd]+"pianoKey", keyToNote(keyInd), ON, voiceInd+3)
		else
			send(pianoAdress[keyInd]+"pianoKey", keyToNote(keyInd), OFF, voiceInd+3)
			pianoAddresses.remove(keyInd)

MARKOV MODEL FILE FORMAT (for one markov model)

voice/midi channel
number of states
midiMelody1.midi midiMelody2.midi...... (strings of midi file names OR gridState files)
probability matrix row 1
probability matrix row 2
...... rest of the rows of the probability matrix

______________________________________________________________________________________________

testing order:
	File parsing
	
	ONE COMPUTER
	client hanlder functions (send from chuck)
		and basic logic checking
	LANdini sanity test
	server (write a chuck loop to catch/print messages in order)
		and bsaic logic checking
		send thru landini
	
	TWO COMPUTERS
	do 1 computer things across computer (send messages from comp1 to comp2)
	run a real version across 2 computers
		
______________________________________________________________________________________________

server and client doing markov steps together when comp addresses is ['all']
markov Button working
Piano Button not working, but chuck simulation of it works
____________________________
messages successfully sending over network with "all" as address
____________________________
fixed bug, now multiple voices should play on one client 
____________________________
Everything seems to be working with normal markov,
	but sweeps doesn't send signals to anything but itself (might just require restart)

added fix for making MarkovButton work with multi-voice change in client
	(NOT TESTED)
	
Piano mode problem still not solved 

____________________________

ensuring no "overlap" of melodies on computer seems to be working. 
created a setup for testing with only 3 computers, so no "blank spots"
	from sending to non existent addresses 
	
____________________________
non overlapping markov melodies working

coded up simpler non-overlapping piano movement 
	that is analagous to markov melody movement
