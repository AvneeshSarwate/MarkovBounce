class Listener
	
	voices - list of list of progressions
		voices[i] is a list of progressions of voice i
		voices[i][j] is nth progression of voice i
	progInd - what step in the progression it is
	voiceInd - which voice to play
	stateInd - which state/prog to play
	playing - whether the loop is playing

	realPlay()
		if playing
			phrase.play(voices[voiceInd][stateInd][progInd], voiceInd) //voiceInd specifies midi channel
			progInd += 1
			progInd %= 16

	changeState() - in response to state button push
		state = stuff[0]

	startVoice() - in response to automatic state change form Markov Chain
		voiceInd = stuff[0]
		stateInd = stuff[1]
		playing = true
	//watch out for state of “playing" variable. make sure this and realPLay() don’t block each other

	pianoKey() - in response to a piano key down/up.  stuff = [note, on/off, channel]
		phrase.play(stuff[0], stuff[1], stuff[2])
	//“note" here is a chord object with 1 note in it
	//will receive a single midi note value, must put it into a chord before playing

class Sender

	MarkovChain - a stochastic matrix
	addresses - a list of addresses of computers in the network
	MarkovAddress - address of the computer currently playing the meldoy
	pianoAddresses - pianoKey to address mapping
		when a key goes down, that key is mapped to an address. when it comes up, the address is cleared
	keyToNote - the “key to note" mapping 
	stateInd, voiceInd, progInd - as above
	
	stepper() - in response to the metronome
		if progInd == 0 //ideally all files start on same index and metronome beat
			markovAddress = adresses[random(0-9)]
			stateInd = randomMarkovStep(markovChain, stateInd)
			send(markovAddress+"startVoice", voiceInd, state)

	markovButton() - in response to a top row button being pressed
		stateInd = addrToInd(addr)
		sebd(markovAddress+"changeState", stateInd)

	pianoButton()
		keyInd = addrToInd(addr)
		if stuff[0] == 1
			pianoAddresses[keyInd] = addresses[randpm(0-9)]
			send(pianoAdress[keyInd]+"pianoKey", keyToNote(keyInd), ON, voiceInd+3)
		else
			send(pianoAdress[keyInd]+"pianoKey", keyToNote(keyInd), OFF, voiceInd+3)
			pianoAddresses.remove(keyInd)

MARKOV MODEL FILE FORMAT (for one markov model)

voice/midi channel
number of states
midiMelody1.midi midiMelody2.midi...... (strings of midi file names OR gridState files)
probability matrix row 1
probability matrix row 2
...... rest of the rows of the probability matrix

______________________________________________________________________________________________

testing order:
	File parsing
	
	ONE COMPUTER
	client hanlder functions (send from chuck)
		and basic logic checking
	LANdini sanity test
	server (write a chuck loop to catch/print messages in order)
		and bsaic logic checking
		send thru landini
	
	TWO COMPUTERS
	do 1 computer things across computer (send messages from comp1 to comp2)
	run a real version across 2 computers
		
______________________________________________________________________________________________
server and client doing markov steps together when comp addresses is ['all']
markov Button working
Piano Button not working, but chuck simulation of it works

messages successfully sending over network with "all" as address

fixed bug, now multiple voices should play on one client 

Everything seems to be working with normal markov,
	but sweeps doesn't send signals to anything but itself (might just require restart)
